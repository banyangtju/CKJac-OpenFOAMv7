# CKJac installation and usage:
   The LoadBalancedChemistryModel is derived from DLBFoam (https://github.com/Aalto-CFD/DLBFoam), and integrates the recently developed **CKJac** (for more details in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010218024004978) chemistry model for computational speedup.

   The chemical model program, **CKJac**, provides the pre-computed and pre-saved fully analytic molar concentration-based and more spare Jacobian and chemical reaction sources, accelerating chemical reaction computation, which occupies 80% CPU time during CFD simulations. The speedup performance depends on chemical mechanisms, and more details can be found in our article.

   When using the CKJac chemistry model, a library called **libchemkin.so** should be generated in constant/chemkin. The libchemkin.so is produced based on chemkin-type reaction mechanisms ï¼ˆchem.bin). The Linux executable program JAC can be found in tutorials/chemFoam/CH4Air_GRIMech3.0/constant/chemkin. When using JAC, chem.bin should be provided in the same file directory and you can use the tutorials/chemFoam/CH4Air_GRIMech3.0/constant/chemkin/ckinterp/ to produce chem.bin. Thus, the operating steps are:

```
cd tutorials/chemFoam/CH4Air_GRIMech3.0/constant/chemkin/ckinterp/
make clean;make
cp -r ./chem.bin ../
./JAC/
```
   
   The advantages of CKJac can be found in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. After installing the library **libchemistryModel_LB_LB_pyJac_LB_CKJac.so** and **libchemkin.so**, you can use it in constant/chemistryProperties,

```
chemistryType
{
    solver          ode;
    method          LB_CKJac;//LB;//LB_pyJac;//
}
```

and in system/controlDict
```
libs
(
	"$FOAM_CASE/constant/chemkin/libchemkin.so"
	"libchemistryModel_LB_LB_pyJac_LB_CKJac.so"
//	"libODE_seulex_LAPACK_seulex_KLU.so"
//	"$FOAM_CASE/constant/foam_mech/libc_pyjac.so"
)
```

# Attention:
   1. The ODE solvers including seulex_KLU (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001021801630267X) for CKJac (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010218024004978) and seulex_LAPACK (https://github.com/Aalto-CFD/DLBFoam) for pyJac (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465517300462) are uploaded. 
   2. CKJac can identify various common reactions (such as pressure-dependent reactions with Lindemann, SRI, and Troe forms, and Landau-Teller Formulation reactions).
