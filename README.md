# OpenFOAMv7-CKJac-LoadBalancedChemistryModel
The LoadBalancedChemistryModel is derived from DLBFoam (https://github.com/Aalto-CFD/DLBFoam), and integrates the recently developed  CKJac (for more details in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010218024004978) chemistry model for computational speedup.
